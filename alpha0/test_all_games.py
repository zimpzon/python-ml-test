""""

    This is a Regression Test Suite to automatically test all combinations of games and ML frameworks. Each test
    plays two quick games using an untrained neural network (randomly initialized) against a random player.

    In order for the entire test suite to run successfully, all the required libraries must be installed.  They are:
    Pytorch, Keras.
